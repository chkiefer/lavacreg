Description: Estimation of a multi-group count regression models (i.e., Poisson, 
    negative binomial) with latent covariates. This packages provides two extensions
    compared to ordinary count regression models based on a generalized linear model:
    First, measurement models for the predictors can be specified allowing to account 
    for measurement error. Second, the count regression can be simultaneously estimated 
    in multiple groups with stochastic group weights. The marginal maximum likelihood 
    estimation is described in Kiefer & Mayer (2020) <doi:10.1080/00273171.2020.1751027>.
